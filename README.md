## Let's get to the murder
    "A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
    You vaguely remember that the crime was a â€‹murderâ€‹ that occurred sometime on â€‹Jan.15, 2018â€‹ and that it took place in â€‹SQL Cityâ€‹." 
    
```sql
SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
where date = 20180115 and type = "murder" and city = "SQL City"
```
